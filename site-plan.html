        Why Us?

        Although we welcome all to this site, we are especially targeting
        young adults/college students. We came up with this site with them in mind. 
        It’s a unique time-period in their lives after they turn adults and have more 
        freedom, and in a lot of cases, more money (at least compared to high school…), 
        to go and make some special memories before family or a career, or both get in 
        the way. Whether you want to make those memories with a special someone, 
        a few friends, or a large group, we want to take away the planning part from you
        (for the most part) so you can spend more time just making memories and not 
        stressing about the logistics. Especially with larger groups it can make planning 
        and organizing the trips stressful, and take away from the fun somewhat, and 
        we don’t want that to happen to you (we were once college students too...). 
        We want you to be able to look back with nothing but a smile on your face on how 
        fun this time of life was for you.

        What we need from you

        Where you’re located, group size, the general area you want your trips around 
        (if you have specific locations in that area you want to go to include them), 
        time period you want us to plan for (like the whole semester? Just for the second 
        half? Or just 1 particular weekend?), how often you want to go on trips if you 
        plan on going on as many as possible, road trip or flight (if you have an airport 
        preference, tell us), and a general budget for the trip (under 100, 100-500, 
        500-1000, etc.). We will include a section where you can make special requests 
        that we will do our best to meet, but in general this is the general info we need 
        from you to be able to plan out a good trip(s). If the area you want to go to is 
        too expensive for the general budget you gave us, we will send an email to you to
        contact us to discuss other options if you feel like our plan would be too far 
        over your budget. If you decide that you don’t want to try anywhere else, we will
        refund you the full amount. We are on your team as long as you’re willing to work 
        with us.

        What we do for you

        Using Excel, we will create a spreadsheet plan for you. Included will be 
        the date(s), location(s), travel time, possible travel costs (depends on 
        whether a road trip, or flight, and if you have to rent a car/take public
        transportation), necessary items to bring (+costs for trips with special 
        gear needed like camping), estimated costs for event (like if you need to 
        pay to get in, or pay for certain benefits to get access to special events)
        estimated time at location/event (like if it’s a hike, how long will it 
        take to get to the good spots on that hike), what to expect at location/event,
        nearby food spots to try (if not bringing packed food, will include estimated 
        costs), any other special notes that we feel like you should know about, and 
        estimated total costs and if they fall into your budget or not. We will also 
        include a little check box column where you can mark on your own whether the 
        trip was successful or not (a good thing to do so you can reference in the 
        future when you are planning more trips). Included when we send you the 
        spreadsheet will be suggested sites to visit if you decide you want to do
        your own research or change your mind about 1 of the locations and want 
        to try something else.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I hope the wireframe makes it clear enough, but the home page is simply focused
        on why they should join us. There will be a link if they feel they are ready after
        reading the intro paragraph, but if not there will be links to the other 2 pages.

        Pretty simple, explains what we need from them and there will be examples of what to include.

      <h3>Our Part</h3>

        Explains what we do, shows an example, and ultimately what we want for them. May change that later to be honest,
        but for now I feel good about it.
