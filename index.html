        <h1 class="home-title">Why Us?</h1>
        <p class="home-p">
            Although we welcome all to this site, we are especially targeting
        young adults/college students. We came up with this site with them in mind. 
        It’s a unique time-period in their lives after they turn adults and have more 
        freedom, and in a lot of cases, more money (at least compared to high school…), 
        to go and make some special memories before family or a career, or both get in 
        the way. Whether you want to make those memories with a special someone, 
        a few friends, or a large group, we want to take away the planning part from you
        (for the most part) so you can spend more time just making memories and not 
        stressing about the logistics. Especially with larger groups it can make planning 
        and organizing the trips stressful, and take away from the fun somewhat, and 
        we don’t want that to happen to you (we were once college students too...). 
        We want you to be able to look back with nothing but a smile on your face on how 
        fun this time of life was for you.
